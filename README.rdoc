== Welcome to Galleryd

This is just an initial sketch in code of an idea for a service that is focused around art shows, allowing you to know where and when they are on, note your interest in visiting the show and sharing your experience and thoughts of the show afterwards.

Its written with Ruby on Rails and is an experiment in using Twitter Bootstrap as well.
